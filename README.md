Hi Albert, 

Our apologies for the unorganized repository, but everything should work fine. The data set is not on the repository, but we've refered to it in the paper, and [here's a link.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset)

We advise against trying to run most methods, as it can easily take hours on a GPU/TPU, but you can try of course! There's also quite some commented out code, which is mostly due to first selectively running experiments to save time and second that the code needs to be adapted based on the hardwarde it's run on.

Lastly, for the most part our code matches the paper, but in some cases it might diverge. This is nearly always due to us having done many more experiments than the paper mentions. The paper is accurate, so when conflicts arise, follow the paper.

Thanks for the course! 

Regards,
Joren, Eeke, Mees, Karen, Emma, and Teun
